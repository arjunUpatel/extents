# kernl-hax
My journey into the Linux kernel. Linux 5.15 was modified in the following ways to learn more about linux subsystems

## memory management

## scheduler
- talk about both the approaches and what you learned about in each one

## the peripherials
- talk about the papers you read, syscall integration, ssafely copying pointers from userland
- how macros can be used to turn on different functionality
- smart macro work to traverse the linkedlists and get the containing node of a given ll node
